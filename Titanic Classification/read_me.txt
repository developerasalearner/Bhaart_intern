As a data science student, I took on a project to build a prediction system that could accurately predict the aliveness of individuals who were on board the Titanic during its tragic incident. To achieve this, I utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and K-Fold cross-validation technique.

To begin, I sourced the Titanic dataset which contained valuable information about the passengers on board such as their age, gender, passenger class, and survival status. I then preprocessed the data by handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

Next, I implemented the KNN algorithm to build the prediction model. The KNN algorithm is a type of supervised learning that can be used for classification and regression tasks. It works by calculating the distance between the input data point and the k nearest neighbors in the training set. The class of the input data point is then assigned based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors.

To optimize the performance of my model, I utilized K-Fold cross-validation. This technique involved splitting the dataset into k equally sized subsets, training the model on k-1 of those subsets, and validating the model on the remaining subset. This process was repeated k times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The results were then averaged to provide an accurate estimate of the model's performance.

After training and validating my model, I evaluated its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. I then made predictions on a test dataset to see how well my model would perform on unseen data.

Through this project, I learned the importance of data preprocessing and optimization techniques such as K-Fold cross-validation. I also gained valuable experience in implementing machine learning algorithms such as KNN for classification tasks. Overall, this project allowed me to apply my knowledge in data science to a real-world problem and sharpen my skills in machine learning.
